`/square`

Follow the instructions in the root readme to boot a fake galaxy and to start the app.

Then, poke the app with a number, more specifically data with the mark of 'atom':

`:examples-square 5`

You should see:

`[%square 9]`

In short, the `/square` app received our number on the `++poke-atom` arm, which simply prints out the square of that number.
