`%ford examples`

This directory contains example `%ford` pages.

Copy them into your pier with (something like):

    cp -r ./web/*/ /path/to/your/ship/desk

You can then access them through the web:
    
    http://localhost:8080/pages/[n]

or
    
    http://localhost:8080/pages/[n]/page

where `[n]` is the number of the example.
