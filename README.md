# Introduction

This repository contains some example code for Urbit. There are
generators (`dojo` commands) in `dojo/`, libraries in `libs/`, HTML
frontends generated by `%ford` in `ford/`, and full `%gall` applications
in `gall/`.

# Installation

The `%examples` desk on `~wactex-ribmex` contains all the examples in
this repository. To get these examples on your urbit, you can set up a
sync from `~wactex-ribmex` to your own `%examples` desk:

```dojo
|sync %examples ~wactex-ribmex %examples
activated sync from %examples on ~wactex-ribmex to %examples
sync succeeded from %examples on ~wactex-ribmex to %examples
```

Change your current directory to the `%examples` desk:

```dojo
> /=examples=
```

if you want to use a generator:

```dojo
> +hello
"hello, world."
```

or a library:

```dojo
> /+  sorts
> test:sorts
[~[4 5 6 10] ~[4 5 6 10]]
```

Navigate to example `%ford` pages at
http://your-ship.urbit.org/examples/fordn (with the appropriate number
for `n`), or http://localhost:8080/examples/fordn if you're not routed
through `~doznec`. To start example `%gall` apps, use `|start %examples
%name`.

# Feedback
